# VBA_challenge
Using VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
I Used some ChatGPT in order to figure out 'Set summaryTable = ws.Range()' explanation.
I Used Youtube to figure out 'Select Case' Structure and implementation. 
I also used some Stack overflow in order to nail down 'Yearly Change' aspect of the script.
I was also helped by some of my classmates who had some insight on the structure of defining variables and struturing some of my if statements.
