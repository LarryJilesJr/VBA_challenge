# VBA_challenge
Using VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
I Used ChatGPT in order to figure out how to set up the skeleton of my script. Explanation was kind of vague but accompanied with the 'Credit Card checker' file we went over in class, I was able to fill in a lot of the gaps. 
I Used Youtube to figure out 'Select Case' Structure and implementation. 
I also used some Stack overflow in order to nail down 'Yearly Change' aspect of the script.
I was helped by some of my classmates who had some insight on the structure of defining variables, as well as struturing some of my if statements.
